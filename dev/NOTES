When I change passability rules I have to reload the session. Not good. The
saved session should pick up this rule change automatically. Passability is a
game or at least a scenario-level rule.

Added libtcod for FOV. It comes in a tarball with a non-standard build system
and compiled libraries. A copy of libtcod.so must be placed where libtcodpy.py
can find it (typically the same dir as the executable). I don't like this and
am tempted to duplicate the raytracing code into a python C module.

If the saved maps refer to terrains as objects then the objects must be saved
in the same pickle file. If those in turn refer to sprites then those must be
saved as well, and they will refer to images, so that's bust. Yes, sprites
currently allocate images in their ctors.

Currenty the saved map refers to terrain classes and I patch these with
sprites at runtime. That works ok. Python is the scripting language, so why
not? In the newer code I see I was trying to do terrain as objects allocated
from a json spec. But I think I would prefer doing it in classes for power even
if there were no other reason.
